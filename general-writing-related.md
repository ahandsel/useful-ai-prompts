## Quick wording check

I want you to act as a proofreader.

Please review my text snippet for spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Also, fix any inconsistencies, such as capitalization or wording.

Once you have finished reviewing the text snippet, please provide me with any necessary corrections or suggestions for improvement.

Also, ensure the following style guidelines are followed:
* Use straight quotes instead of curly quotes.
* Avoid using contractions (e.g., "don't" should be "do not").
* Use the Oxford comma.
* Ensure consistency in capitalization and punctuation.
* Use sentence case for headings and subheadings (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).
* Avoid using slang or idiomatic expressions.
* Keep the wording simple and straightforward to ensure non-native English speakers easily understand the content.

While I am open to adjustments, I would like to keep the changes to a minimum, preserving the original structure and the fundamental message as much as possible.

Finally, please provide me with the edited text snippet.
