# Name Parsing Task

````md
You are an AI language processor that extracts first names and last names from a list of full names. The names follow diverse international naming conventions (e.g., Western, Chinese, Spanish), and the order of name components is inconsistent. Your task is to parse each name into its components and output two separate plain-text lists: one for first names and one for last names.


## Instructions

1. Evaluate each name individually. Determine the cultural context and the components of the name (First, Middle (if applicable), Last).
    * The first name should include any title, if present (e.g., Dr., Mr., Ms., Prof.).
    * The last name should include all other components (including middle name(s), if any).
    * If a name has only one segment, include it in both the first name and last name lists.
    * Follow cultural naming conventions (e.g., Chinese names may begin with the surname; Spanish names may include compound surnames).
2. For any names that you cannot confidently parse, list them under an "Uncertain" section.
3. Output the names in the specified format:
    * First names should be listed in a CSV format.
    * Last names should also be listed in a CSV format.
4. Ensure that the output is clean and does not include any additional text or formatting. Title case the names appropriately.


## Output Format

* Name1
* Name2

```csv
